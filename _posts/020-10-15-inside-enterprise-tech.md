# A Clear Communication Strategy
<p class="lead">Information-focused website for the Enterprise Technology group at Disney.</p>
Inside Enterprise Technology is an internal employee comms website. This was a redesign of an existing WordPress site. The segment was looking for an updated experience that addressed some usability concerns. 
## The Problem
Too much to look at. User interviews revealed an overwhelming amount of content that was often repeated from other systems. “A big jumble of information. I don’t know what’s important here.” Additional concerns, included:

* Lack of visual hierarchy and a clear content strategy.
* Inconsistent use of branding and colors.
* Text embedded in graphics limiting accessibility.
* Redundant content from other systems.



Before the redesign, The Inside Enterprise Technology website displayed a lot of content competing for valuable user attention.
## Challenges/Constraints
The project came with the following challenges: 

* The Enterprise Publishing platform provides limited opportunity to customize the experience. 
* The total experience includes the 6 business areas of Enterprise Technology, each with their own domains and stakeholders.
* Multiple Style guides—the Company style guide, plus the Segment style guide.

## What I Did
* Conducted employee and stakeholder interviews.
* Developed information architecture and content strategy.
* Created wireframes and mockups. 
* Staged and built changes in Wordpress.



After the redesign, a clear and focused content strategy effectively communicates important information.
## Process 
* Understand what users are seeking and most interested in, and focus the content strategy to serve their needs.
* Remove content repeated from other systems, and limit offerings to content that is unique to Enterprise Technology.
* Work with individual segments to align on an overall content strategy and consistent application of style guide.

## Outcomes
Stakeholders and users are impressed with the new design and agreed it was a vast improvement over the original. 

This project is still due to launch.
