# A Richer Experience
<p class="lead">A lively marketing website for Partners Credit Union delivers a responsive, inclusive, and on-brand experience.</p>

Partners Federal Credit Union wanted a heavily themed and image-rich marketing website, while meeting 
accessibility guidelines.

## The Problem
The current Partners website was functional, but did not meet required accessibility guidelines. Additionally, Partners wanted a visual redesign to showcase regular offers and giveaways.

The original partners website visual design was functional but dated, and did not meet  accessibility guidelines.


## Goals
* Updated visual design that showcased branded promotions
* Comply with accessibility standards and guidelines

## What I Did
I created a new design that allowed the home page to take on a theme and carry it on to the rest of the marketing pages.The design is responsive and adheres to WCAG 2.0 AA requirements.

* Created wireframes, mockups, and visual design comps and style guide.
* Accessibility auditing and remediation.

To showcase frequent promotions, the background image and homepage hero image work together to create an immersive, themed experience.

## Process
I worked closely with the developer to ensure all code complied with standards, and  that any custom components were fully accessible. I provided guidelines on creating accessible content for editors.
