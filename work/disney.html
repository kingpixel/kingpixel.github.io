            <p>Most of my career, I've been enabling a mobile-first workforce through mobile apps and technology. The first mobile enterprise app I created for Disney was for the BlackBerry, and now I make apps for iOS and Android. I introduced Web Standards and semantics to enterprise products, and built some of the first responsive web experiences at Disney.</p>
