            <h3>The Enterprise Experience</h3>
            <p>For 15 years, it's been my job to bring modern, consumer-like experiences to enterprise software. As part of Enterprise Technology at Disney, my work touches a large number of Disney employees. I get to work on critical behind-the-scenes magic!</p>

            <p>Most of my career, I've been enabling a mobile-first workforce through mobile apps and technology. The first mobile enterprise app I created for Disney was for the BlackBerry, and now I make apps for iOS and Android. I introduced Web Standards and semantics to enterprise products, and built some of the first responsive web experiences at Disney.</p>

            <p>In a large company, it can be difficult to locate just the right person. I design products and features that enable employees to find one another easily by expertise, skillset, location and more. These easy-to-use tools are extremely popular, and included in many critical workflows.</p>
